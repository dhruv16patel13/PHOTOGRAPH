						I don't want to give you up  <br /> 
						maybe in time you'll love me just as much  <br /> 
						I've got a way of making mistakes  <br /> 
						and you've got a smile every time my heart breaks.  <br />

					Were both strangers finding our way together <br /> 
					Like two lights that dance through the dark <br /> 
					We shine bright and fade out into forever <br />
